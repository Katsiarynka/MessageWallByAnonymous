Anonymous message wall.
It is necessary to implement a simple message feed with tree-like comment messages.
Creating messages in the feed and adding is possible for all visitors.

Capabilities:

1. View the tape.
Displays all root (no comments) in the order in which the last comment was added
messages with messages of the most recent. It is enough to display messages with a number and text.

2. Adding messages. Occurs on separate pages.
It just adds text to the text field. After successful addition, the visitor returns to
previous page.

3. View the comments of the posts. You can view from the root
messages that can be posted and posted with any comment in village comments. The comment tree is ordered,
tree layout with padding, tree branches sorted by comment date.
For each post, print the comment number, text, and a link to view the thread from
this comment.

4. Adding a comment to the comment tree. Under the message and to everyone
comment on a frequently occurring link, by clicking on this block with a text field for
entering comment text from the "add" and "cancel" buttons. "Add" - a comment is added
to the right place in the comment hierarchy without reloading the page.

5. On each page in the header there should be 2: "the main link of the page" and "add a message".
There can be a lot of messages in this feed (about), there are also a lot of comments (for example, thousands
one message). You need to make sure that the functionality works when using digital data.


Everything else is optional.
